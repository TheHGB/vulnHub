found users.txt.bak using annonymous login through ftp
from the backup_wordpress/?feed=rss2 you know admin is John
after running wpscan you confirm that john is an admin user, then, with the same tool a bruteforce can be done
it is found that the password for john is enigma
now with metasploit you can get a shell
after some enumeration you see that there is a cronjob executing cleanup as root. cleanup can be modified by anyone
just edit cleanup to execute a reverse python shell and wait

You are in as root and you can cat the flag:

Congratulations!

If you can read this, that means you were able to obtain root permissions on this VM.
You should be proud!

There are multiple ways to gain access remotely, as well as for privilege escalation.
Did you find them all?
